# EdgeTX Playground
A place for 'unsupported' scripts, code changes and modifications can be shared

The underlying goal of this repo is to provide a space where documentation and code related to the EdgeTX firmware can be shared. 

For example, if you want to build EdgeTX on Ubuntu 21.04, and have modified the build scripts to work there, this is where that sort of script can be shared. If you've modified other parts of the firmware or build system beyond the 'supported' configuration... this is the place to share it. You never know, if enough people are interested, it might make it into EdgeTX one day!
